### BASIC OVERVIEW ###

This folder contains my original implementation of Circular Linked Lists in C++. I designed the entire logic myself from scatch, afer encountering various incorrect and inconsistent solutions online. I visualised all implementations and performed dry runs. Hope to optimise the program in the future, as I progress further.

### CONTENTS ###

"Codes" -> C++ programs for Insertions, Deletions. Implemented from scratch.

"Notes" -> COMING SOON. (Only handwritten rough notes as of now)

### IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS (till date) ###

Operations -> Traverse, Count

Insertions -> Inserting in the beginning, end, and at a specific postion.

Deletions -> Deleting from the beginning, end, and at a specific postion.
