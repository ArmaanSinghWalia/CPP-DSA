### BASIC OVERVIEW ###

This folder contains all codes and notes related to Doubly Linked Lists implemented in C++.
DLLs allow bidirectional traversal, making them both easier to use but complex to implement than SLLs.

### CONTENTS ###

"Codes" -> C++ programs for Insertions, Deletions, and other operations.

"Notes" -> Visual '.docx' Notes, with code snippets, explaning the WHY's and the HOW's.

### IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS (till date) ###

Operations -> Traversal, Counting number of nodes.

Insertions -> Inserting in the beginning, end, and at a specific postion.

Deletions -> Deleting from the beginning, end, and at a specific postion.

COMING SOON -> Search, Reverse, etc.
